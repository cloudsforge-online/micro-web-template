/**
 * A real browser, driven by `playwright-core`, for the tier-1 and tier-2 scenarios of
 * docs/ecosystem/22-browser-journeys.md.
 *
 * ── Why a real browser, when the rest of this suite deliberately has no DOM ────────────────────
 *
 * `test/browser-stubs.ts` states the estate's position and it is the right one for what it covers:
 * jsdom is a second browser implementation to keep current, and a test that renders a component in
 * it proves the component renders in jsdom. Nothing here contradicts that. This file does not add
 * jsdom; it adds the actual engine, which is the only thing that can answer the questions doc 22
 * asks — did the bundle load, did the application mount, did anything go to the console, did any
 * request fail, and what did the client SEND.
 *
 * ── Why `playwright-core` and not `playwright` ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The full package downloads its own ~1.5 GB browser set on install. The core package drives a
 * Chromium that is already on the machine. Every GitHub `ubuntu-latest` runner ships Google Chrome
 * and Chromium (runner-images: Ubuntu2404-Readme.md, "Browsers and Drivers"), so CI needs no extra
 * step and no workflow change. The frozen legacy estate reached the same conclusion and recorded
 * it at `stack/infra/beacon/src/browser.js:9-11`.
 *
 * ── Why a missing browser is a FAILURE and not a skip ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This estate keeps producing checks that cannot fail: a Docker job that built an image and read
 * its metadata without ever running it, grep rules that skip files with NUL bytes in them, and a
 * unit test asserting that the client posts to the URL the client was written to post to. A
 * browser suite that quietly skips itself when it cannot find a browser is the same defect in its
 * purest form — it would be green on every runner in the estate and would have proven nothing.
 *
 * So `chromePath()` throws, and names every path it looked in. If you are running this on a
 * machine with a browser somewhere unusual, set `CF_CHROME`. There is deliberately no
 * `CF_SKIP_BROWSER_TESTS`.
